REQUIREMENTS

ASSEMBLER
To run these codes, an assembler is required.
MASM 8086 has been used to develop and test the codes. A copy has been included in the repository.

DOS-ENVIRONMENT
If an OS supprting execution of dos commands is not available, emulators can be used.
Two of such emulators are :
1) DosBox - http://www.dosbox.com/
2) DosEmulator (Only Linux and some unix systems) - http://www.dosemu.org/

DosEmulator allows hardware support, while DosBox doesn't. Either could be used for software programs.
